    return "May require additional resource allocation"
```

**2. Solution Quality Forecasting**
```python
# Advanced confidence calibration predicts solution quality
class QualityPredictor:
    def predict_solution_quality(self, reasoning_trace):
        coherence = self.analyze_reasoning_coherence(reasoning_trace)
        consistency = self.measure_cross_level_consistency(reasoning_trace)
        efficiency = self.calculate_process_efficiency(reasoning_trace)
        
        predicted_quality = (coherence + consistency + efficiency) / 3.0
        return predicted_quality
```
