# 🤖 GodMode Real AI Setup Instructions

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: This system now uses REAL AI - no templates or hardcoded content

### 🔑 Required: OpenRouter API Key

1. **Get OpenRouter API Key:**
   - Go to https://openrouter.ai/
   - Sign up and get your API key
   - You'll need credits to make API calls

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Create your own .env file (NOT tracked by git)
   echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
   
   # Option 2: Export in terminal
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```

   **🔒 SECURITY NOTE:** Your `.env` file is NOT tracked by git and will stay private.

3. **Verify Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Test that the API key is loaded
   python3 -c "import os; print('API Key loaded:', bool(os.getenv('OPENROUTER_API_KEY')))"
   ```

### 🚀 Launch Real AI System

```bash
# Start GodMode with real AI
godmode web

# The system will now:
# ✅ Use OpenRouter API for ALL predictions
# ✅ Generate genuinely intelligent responses
# ✅ Use HRM for enhanced reasoning
# ✅ Create contextual conversation simulations
# ❌ NO templates, NO hardcoded content
```

### 🧪 Test Real AI Intelligence

Ask questions like:
- "My house was flooded while it snowed, how?"
- "How does quantum computing work?"
- "I want my girl to come back"

**BEFORE (Template Garbage):**
- "Let me explain house comprehensively..."
- Generic keyword substitution
- Template responses

**NOW (Real AI):**
- Contextual, intelligent analysis
- Genuine understanding of the question
- Smart, helpful responses
- No template bullshit

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Error: "OpenRouter API key required"**
- Solution: Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable

**Error: "Failed to initialize conversation predictor"**
- Solution: Check your API key is valid and has credits

**Still seeing template responses?**
- This should be IMPOSSIBLE now - all template code removed
- If you see this, something is seriously wrong

### 🎯 What You Get Now

- **100% Real AI:** Every response generated by Claude/GPT models
- **HRM Enhanced:** Hierarchical reasoning for complex questions  
- **Contextual Intelligence:** Understands your actual question
- **No Templates:** Zero hardcoded content anywhere
- **Genuine Predictions:** Real conversation trajectory analysis

### 💡 API Cost Considerations

- Each prediction makes multiple API calls
- Costs depend on your OpenRouter plan
- Consider rate limiting for production use

## 🔥 BOTTOM LINE

This is now a **genuine AI system** that uses real language models for every prediction. No more template garbage, no more keyword substitution bullshit. 

**Set your API key and experience real AI intelligence.** 🚀
